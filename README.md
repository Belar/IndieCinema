# Indie Cinema

Indie Cinema is a web application that builds index of Vimeo videos from groups (potentially also from other sources like channels and categories) dedicated to independent film.

## Current development state

What you can see now is a front-end prototype using [Indie](https://vimeo.com/groups/indie) group for video data. If you would like to run the application, all you need to do is execute:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

It's using VueJS and its [Webpack template](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/). Back-end is planned to use [HapiJS](http://hapijs.com/).
